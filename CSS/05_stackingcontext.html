<!--

Explanation :
The code defines a container with class "con" that has a fixed width and height, and a background color of "peru". Inside this container, there are two boxes with class "box1" and "box2".
"box1" has a width and height of 200px and a background color of "purple". It is positioned absolutely with respect to the container's top-left corner using the "top" and "left" properties. It has a z-index of 15, which means it will be stacked on top of "box2".
"box2" has a width and height of 90px and a background color of "rgb(38, 120, 51)". It is also positioned absolutely with respect to the container's top-left corner. It has a z-index of 10, which means it will be stacked behind "box1".
The stacking order of elements is determined by their z-index values. Elements with higher z-index values will be stacked on top of elements with lower z-index values. If two elements have the same z-index, the element that appears later in the HTML markup will be stacked on top.
